to start:
1. we will use a functional component for todo-item and todo-form, to list and add todos, 
2. and a class for todo-list, so we can use its state to propogate updates to its children and
keep todos on the list.

files:
* `./todo-list.jsx` - list class component
* `./todo-form.jsx` - function form component
* `./todo-item.jsx` - function item component
* `./index.jsx` - main component file
